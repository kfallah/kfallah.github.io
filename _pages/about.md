##### Background
Hi, welcome to my personal page! I am a research scientist at [Waabi](waabi.ai), working on the next generation of autonomous driving technology. Specifically, I work on AI-based traffic-model simulation to improve and validate the autonomy stack. Before this position, I completed my Ph.D in machine learning at Georgia Institute of Technology under the supervision of [Professor Chris Rozell](https://siplab.gatech.edu/rozell.html).

##### Prior Research
My research was in the intersection of geometric models and deep learning to improve performance with limited labelled data. To achieve this, I would apply techniques like sparse coding, manifold learning, and self-supervised learning. I am interested in building large foundation models with sparse intermediary layers (i.e., only a few elements of each activation non-zero) for interpretability, robustness, and compute efficiency. One approach I have developed uses variational inference to reach similar performance as unrolled optimization routines, like [FISTA](https://www.stat.cmu.edu/~ryantibs/convexopt/lectures/prox-grad.pdf), with a single neural network forward pass.
